# Analyzing Movie Data Set

Our aim in this project is to explore the movie dataset and find some movies with high ratings.
Our friend has just begun with his vacations and wants you to suggest some good movies for him to watch.

Since I have just learned Python, I decided to use my Python skills to analyze a movie dataset and explore the ratings of the movies.
In our dataset, we have the details of the movies in more than 50 languages, but my friend is interested only in watching English movies.

Thus, our goal is to analyze the data and suggest English movies with high-ratings to your friend.
